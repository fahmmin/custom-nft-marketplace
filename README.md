OverView Of the Project

DigiWill is a solution that addresses the challenges faced by users in managing their digital assets. 
With DigiWill, users can designate beneficiaries for their assets in their wallet, which can be claimed by the beneficiaries in the event of the user's death which is determined by a inactive session of 1 year. 
This feature provides a backup plan for lost private keys and ensures that digital assets are distributed according to the owner's intended wishes.
Specifically, WillGuard allows for the setting of beneficiaries to the assets in the wallet as needed  .
